# Iâ€™ll always look out for you 
                >

Iâ€™ll first start by saying I know you know how I feel

And I know you donâ€™t feel the same

To be blunt. I know you donâ€™t love me.

This isnâ€™t a letter that has the intention of repeating sentiments that youâ€™ve heard from me time and time again and the purpose isnâ€™t to get anything out of you either

You donâ€™t need to reply

But I need you to know how incredible you are

We arenâ€™t close now but Iâ€™m positive that these things still apply

You are the kindest person Iâ€™ve ever met and you are so bright and funny and no one has ever made me happier to be around

You genuinely taught me what love means and more than that you taught me how to love someone

Iâ€™ve become the best version of myself and itâ€™s thanks to you

You always inspired me to be better

All I really want is for you to be happy, I wish you as much happiness as I can possibly wish for someone else

You deserve it more than anything

I really just hope you realize how extraordinary you are because I cannot emphasize enough how true it is

How lucky I am just to have known you

I wish you could see yourself through my eyes

Be kind to yourselfðŸ¥°
